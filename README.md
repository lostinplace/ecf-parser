# ECF Parser

## FAQ

### What is this?

The empyrion config files are really hard to work with because they're in a custom format, so I wrote a parser/generator to help work with them.  It includes a very limited object model which is really just an "Entry" to help you work with it in python.

### How do I use it?

Install with pip and use the command line, or use the utility functions as part of the package.

```bash
> pip install ecf_parser



```
